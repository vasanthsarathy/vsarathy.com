<p align="justify"><b>Affordance</b> is a term from cognitive psychology that refers to how objects can be used. For example, the base of a chair (which affords sitting) or the handle on a coffee mug (which affords grasping). </p>

<p align="justify"> In my work on building problem-solving robots, I see the ability to learn and perceive affordances in a flexible manner as being a prerequisite for effectively utilizing available resources. I am developing a new model for representing, learning and reasoning with affordances using probabilistic logic. I am also implementing the model in a distributed cognitive robotic architecture in combination with a PR2 robot. One unique aspect of the approach is the ability to account for changing contexts. So, it will be possible to reason that in certain contexts mugs can be used to drink coffee, while in other contexts mugs can be used as a pen-holder. </p>
