<p><b>Affordance</b> is a term from cognitive psychology that refers to how objects can be used. For example, the base of a chair (which affords sitting) or the handle on a coffee mug (which affords grasping). It's amazing that we, humans, can recognize and make use of affordances effortlessly. What is even more amazing is our ability to consider just the relevant affordances (from amongst an infinte set of possibilities) in a particular context. In this project we are developing computational methods for learning, recognizing and using affordances. </p>
