<p align="justify"><strong>Uncertainty</strong> arises when the information being processed is inherently stochastic (i.e., randomly determined), unknown, incomplete or imperfect in some way. For example, we are uncertain what the next dice roll will be. We model a roll as a probabilistic event, where the chance for each of the numbers 1-6 is 1/6th. A dice roll is inherently random. </p>

<p align="justify">Now, how do we model the probability of an affordance? What is the probability that the mug can be used for drinking coffee versus used as a pen-holder? These are not probabilistic in the same way as a die roll, yet we need some way of handling this sort of <strong>epistemic uncertainty</strong> (uncertainty in knowledge).</p>

<p align="justify">I am developing a set of mathematical tools for <strong>probabilistic logic</strong> using <strong>Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory</strong>. DS theory can be seen as a generalization of Bayesian theory and has some potential benefits over it especially in cases, like the example above, where there can be an infinite number of affordances and we have no sense for what is the probability distribution of the different events. One benefit of the approach is that we can use intervals in place of binary (true/false) truth values or even point probability truth values to represent the truth as well as the confidence of propositions and rules.</p>
