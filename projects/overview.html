<p align="justify">My research explores the basic computational principles in <strong>creative problem-solving</strong> and <strong>social reasoning</strong>. The research is highly interdisciplinary, linking Computer Science with Philosophy, Psychology and Neuroscience. </p>

<p align="justify">How can robots do creative problem solving while acting within society's normative constraints? For example, how can a robot reason that sometimes a coin can be used as a screwdriver but not always, like when the coin in question is someone else's rare and precious collectable? </p>

<p align="justify">For my dissertation, I am developing computational methods focused on three areas that map to core abilities required for practical creativity:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong> Perceiving Affordances: </strong> Reasoning about functionality of objects in different social contexts. What can and should one do with objects around them?</li>
    <li><strong>Creative Exploration:</strong> How can one extend their knowledge and discover a new action capability, a new concept, or a new use for an object through environmental exploration and play?</li>
    <li><strong>Handling Uncertainty:</strong> How can one reason and make decisions when the information available is uncertain and in short supply?</li>
</ol>

<p>Underlying these areas is a hidden but a equally interesting 4th question: </p>
<ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Machine Ethics:</strong> What are the legal, ethical and moral implications of artificial creative intelligence? Can we use computational methods to ensure robots learn and abide by norms?</li>
</ol>
