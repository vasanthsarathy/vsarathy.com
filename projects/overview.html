<p>My research explores the basic computational principles in creative problem solving.</p> 

<p>I am interested in research topics in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>

<p>I am interested in research topics at the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, visual perception and computational creativity.</p> 

<p>My goal is to build resourceful and responsible robots that can learn. That is, robots with creative, social and moral competence allowing them to serve as our assistants, helpers or scouts, effectively.</p>

<p>My research focuses on developing computational methods that allow robots to detect properties of objects and reason about how they can be used in various situations - for example, using coins as screwdrivers. This requires the robot to not only be resourceful and creative, but also socially and morally aware. Thus, while coins can be used as screwdrivers, they should not be used to cause harm, and maybe that special one-of-a-kind rare 1910 Quarter should not be used at all.</p>
