<p>Here are some ethics-related questions that I find intriguing:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Should robots break and bend the rules when problem-solving? If so, when is it permissible to do so?</li>
    <li>Who is responsible when a creative robot causes harm? Is it the programmer, the robot itself or some other party?</li>
    <li>What ethical principles must we keep in mind when designing algorithms that are specifically for the purpose of creativity and problem-solving?</li>
</ol>
