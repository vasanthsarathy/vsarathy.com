<p align="justify">I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Cognitive Science  at <strong>Tufts University</strong>. My research is in <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Machine Ethics</strong>. What cognitive abilities make us clever, resourceful and creative problem solvers? Should we endow robots with these abilities? If so, how?</p>

<p align="justify">I also enjoy drawing <strong>cartoons</strong>. Some of my work can be seen on <a href="http://www.legallydrawn.com" target="_blank">Legally Drawn</a>, cartoons poking fun at law and lawyers. 

<p><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I grew up in Muscat, Oman and moved to the United States for college. After graduating summa cum laude in Electrical Engineering from the <strong>University of Arkansas</strong> in 2003, I studied at MIT, where I conducted research in the mathematical modeling of printed circuit board insulation at the Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems (<a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/lees/" target="_blank">LEES @ RLE</a>). I received a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from <strong>MIT</strong> in 2005. From 2005 to 2013, I worked as an Intellectual Property <strong>Lawyer</strong> at Ropes &amp; Gray, during which time I concurrently obtained a JD from <strong>Boston University School of Law</strong>. My love for science, math, the human thought process and creativity pulled me back into the world of scientific research.</p>
