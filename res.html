				<h2>Research Program </h2>
				<p align="justify"> Our ability to quickly and continually
					<strong>make sense</strong> of the complex and
changing world around us is astounding. It is central to our intelligence and
creativity. We do not necessarily process each and
every thing we see or hear, but instead we decide what the relevant tidbits of
information mean to us. To establish meaning from just a few bits and pieces of
information, we make a host of <strong>assumptions</strong> about the world. Many of these
assumptions are hidden and outside of our conscious awareness. The set of
assumptions we use and how we use them are largely unknown. My <strong>research
	goal</strong> is to uncover the computational nature of
these hidden assumptions and how we make and break them (<a
															 href="http://vsarathy.com/publications/pdfs/research_statement.pdf"><strong>Research
																 Statement</strong></a>).</p>

				<p align="justify">My research is guided by <strong>three
						questions</strong>:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> How can these hidden assumptions be represented (in computational terms)
such that they can be learned flexibly in a variety of ways (incl. under
uncertainty) and invoked at a moment's notice?</li>
					<li> What is the role of these hidden assumptions in sense-making? How are these
assumptions used to resolve perceptual (linguistic and visual) ambiguity and
assist with decision making and action-selection?</li>
					<li> How do we know when these assumptions need to be broken and how do we break
them?</li>
				</ol>


				<p align="justify"> AI has seen rapid progress in recent years, especially with the development of
new deep neural network architectures. However, despite these efforts,
there are many open questions about how to computationalize core human
intelligence capabilities of compositionality, non-monotonic reasoning with symbolic
knowledge, social intelligence and open-world discovery of new knowledge.
Central to my research has been the development and application of techniques
in <strong>knowledge representation and reasoning</strong> as well as in
<strong>uncertainty processing</strong>
that have shown promise. These techniques help us elucidate the more abstract
computational principles -- associated with making and breaking assumptions -- that
are at play during sense-making. </p>

				<h3> Research Results</h3>
				<h4> 1. Language Understanding through Sense-Making </h4> 

				<p align="justify"> Traditionally, natural language processing
					(NLP) has been thought of as a set of
processes arranged in a pipeline where syntactic properties are
extracted before semantics, which in turn are extracted before pragmatics. However,
there has been some evidence in psycholinguistics as well as in cognitive
neuroscience of language to suggest that these processes are not linear
and sequential. I have begun exploring how language
understanding (and particularly resolving linguistic ambiguity) can be achieved
by a more holistic constraint satisfaction process - asking if a particular
grounding "makes sense" given some background knowledge. I have shown various
proof of concepts to suggest that this approach can help resolve pronouns and
indirect speech acts. </p>

				<h4>2. Social Intelligence: Representing and Reasoning with
					Social Norms </h4>


				<p align="justify">
					Human behavior is frequently guided by social and moral
norms; in fact, no societies, no social groups could exist with-
out norms. But, what are these social norms, how are they represented and
how are they used? I have explored the role of social norms in deciding how to
use objects (e.g., how to grab a knife when using it versus when passing it to
someone -- a situation where social safety norms apply). I showed how this
form of social intelligence can be computationalized and implemented in an
embodied robotic system. More generally, normative aspects are highly pervasive
in many different forms of human-human interaction. I showed that centuries old legal precedent can help
us categorize and organize our thinking about norms. Legal principles can
provide a deeper understanding the normative fabric in society and provide
guidance for designing more natural human-robot interactions. At the core of social intelligence is the questions
of how norms are represented. I showed that human norms are context sensitive
and I have developed computational techniques for learning them under uncertainty. </p>

				<h4> 3. Creative Problem Solving </h4>


				<p align="justify"> From time to time, we can break our
					own assumptions giving us
room to assimilate new knowledge and make new discoveries. The processes
underlying creative cognition remains largely unknown. There has been over a
century of psychology and neuroscience research in insight problem-solving,
attempting to understand how humans reframe problems or reconstruct their
mental representations. Modern AI systems are able to generate novel works of
art and music, but they cannot solve problems that require out-of-the-box
thinking. I have begun making some early progress towards formalizing
creative problem solving computationally. Doing so has a two-fold benefit: (1)
allows us construct potentially solvable computer science problems, and (2)
provides a theoretical foundation for constructing stimuli for human-subject
experiments. </p>
